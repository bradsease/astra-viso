Astra Viso
======================================

    Astra Viso is a full-featured toolset for simulating stars and unresolved space objects. With this software it is simple to set up a simulated sensor and begin generating imagery immediately. The tools allow the user to switch between a number of commonly-used internal modeling presets easily while also having the flexibility to override internal modeling with externally-defined functions.
    
    The three classes listed below are the primary interface for users of the Astra Viso package.
